# Docker utility

I started this project out to learn about electron. I never finished it or even bothered to clean the code up. It was just for fun but also kind of cool :)

 - This tool lets you perform pretty standard docker functions from a GUI.
 - Start/Stop/Rename/Delete containers
 - View environment variables and volumes
 - Create new containers from images
 - Launch a shell directly into a running container
 - Etc.
